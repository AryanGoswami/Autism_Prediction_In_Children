#### Dataset --> [Autistic Screening of Children](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/419/autistic+spectrum+disorder+screening+data+for+children)(UCI Machine Learning Repository website) 
#### Autism --> A neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life.
#### Techniques used --> 
                  Encoding(LabelEncoder) 
                  Normalization/Feature Scaling(MinMaxScaler)
                  Hyperparameter Tuning(GridSearchCV)
####  Classifiers --> 
                  KNeighbors Classifier

                  Random Forest Classifier
#### What are Classifiers? -->
       - Classifiers are algorithms that act like sorting tools. Their primary function is to automatically 
         categorize data points into predefined classes or groups.Imagine a spam filter that sorts incoming 
         emails as "spam" or "not spam." That's a classic example of a classifier in action.
       - Think of classifiers as automated decision-makers. 
       - They take a data point (an email, an image, etc.) as input and assign it a specific class label 
         based on what they've learned during training.
       - This training involves feeding the classifier a large dataset where each data point already has a 
         designated class label. 
       - The classifier analyzes the patterns and relationships within this labeled data.
       - Once trained, the classifier can then process new, unseen data and assign class labels based on 
         the knowledge it acquired from the training data.
